# Quiz App

Solo project to further test my React skills and become even more familiar with JSX syntax, similar to React , the quiz app calls from the Open Trivia Database and generates random trivia questions for the user to answer.

## Features

* Quiz Data is loaded from [the Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
* Each random question is rendered to the DOM along with multiple choice answers rendered as reusable component buttons.
* The code was 100% developed by myself, solutions were not given.
* useEffect hook is used to avoid side effects while fetching JSON data in addition to storing my initial state for the quiz questions.

## Technologies

* React
* JSX
* CSS
